KASM, or Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) Advanced Security Module, is a hypervisor that provides advanced security features for virtualized environments. In an AP CSP environment, virtual desktops can be utilized to provide access to necessary software and resources for students who may not have access to them on their personal devices. KASM can be used to ensure the security of the virtual environment and protect against cyber threats.\n",

    "\n",
    "* How does AWS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, and databases, among others. AWS also provides a range of management and deployment tools to help users manage their resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How is AWS useful for projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS can be incredibly useful for projects because it allows users to easily and quickly provision computing resources on an as-needed basis. This means that users can scale their infrastructure up or down depending on the needs of their project, without having to invest in expensive hardware upfront. Additionally, AWS provides a wide range of tools and services that can be used to deploy, manage, and monitor applications running on its infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does DuckDNS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck DNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to map a domain name to a dynamic IP address. Essentially, Duck DNS provides users with a domain name that they can use to access their network or device, even if the IP address of that network or device changes frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How is DuckDNS useful for projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck DNS can be incredibly useful for projects that require remote access to a network or device that has a dynamic IP address. By using a domain name provided by Duck DNS, users can access their network or device from anywhere, even if the IP address of that network or device changes frequently. This can be especially useful for projects that involve remote monitoring, control, or access to IoT devices, or for projects that require remote access to a network or device from multiple locations.\n",

    "2. OpenSSL and LibreSSL are two open-source cryptographic libraries with comparable security features. They both provide support for a broad range of cryptographic algorithms, secure random number generation, SSL/TLS protocol implementation, and X.509 certificate handling. However, LibreSSL aims to update OpenSSL by removing outdated features and introducing new security measures. While both libraries have experienced significant vulnerabilities recently, timely patches were made available to address them.\n",
