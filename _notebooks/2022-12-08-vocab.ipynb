    "- bits: the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1\n",
    "- bytes: grouping of 8 bits\n",
    "- hexadecimal/nibbles: numbering system with base 16\n",
    "- binary numbers\n",
    "    - unsigted integer: whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).\n",
    "    - signed integer: A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]\n",
    "    - floating point: arithmetic that represents real numbers approximately, using an integer with a fixed precision, called the significand\n",
    "- Binary Data Abstractions\n",
    "    - Boolean: a value that is either true or false (1 or 0)\n",
    "    - ASCII: a character encoding standard for electronic communication; diff symbols stand for different numbers; used 1 byte\n",
    "    - Unicode: Unicode is a universal character encoding standard. This standard includes roughly 100000 characters to represent characters of different languages; used 4 bytes\n",
    "    - RGB: color model based on red value, green value, and blue value.\n",
    "- Data Compression:\n",
    "    - Lossy: Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information. When the file is uncompressed, some of the original information is not there, although the user may not notice it.\n",
    "    - Lossless: Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored.\n"

    "- Data Types: a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.\n",
    "- Assignment Operators: sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the variable\n",
    "- Managing Complexity with Variables\n",
    "    - Lists: an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.\n",
    "    - 2D Lists: 2D array is a collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name\n",
    "    - Dictionaries: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs\n",
    "    -Class: static variable that can be declared anywhere at class level with static\n",
    "- Algorithms: a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem\n",
    "- Sequence: the order in which statements are executed\n",
    "- Selection: a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met\n",
    "- Iteration: when the same procedure is repeated multiple times.\n",
    "- Expressions: a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value, as opposed to a “statement” which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn't return anything\n",
    "- Comparison Operators: >, <=, <, =>, ==... operators that compare\n",
    "- Truth Tables: A truth table is a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce.\n",
    "- Characters: a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbo (char)\n",
    "- Strings: A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.\n",
    "- Length: of a string\n",
    "- Concatenation: combining 2 strings\n",
    "- Traversing Strings: accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript\n",
    "- Python If: a statement with an if condition\n",
    "- Elif: else if statement, - if x is true then ___, else do ____\n",

    "P- ython For While loops with Range: a for/while loop that uses the range() function\n",
    "- Python for/while loop with with List: a while/for loop that iterates through a list and applies a certain algo to items in list\n",
    "- Combining loops with conditionals to Break: For certain conditions, the loop will terminate exectution\n",
    "- Python Def procedures (see code block 1)\n",
    "- Parameters: values that are passed through a function\n",
