            "content": ". Questions . A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . What I missed . I missed 7 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only chose 1. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #16: I put that “The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device.” The correct answer was “The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.”. This is because Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly. . Question #17: I put that “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” The correct answer was “Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.” Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . Question #31: I thought that the answer would be f, but it would actually be h. This is because the character “f” is the character at index 3 of the string element at index 2 in wordList. . Question #32: I thought the contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The actual contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70]. This is because The last assignment statement assigns a copy of myList to yourList. Since myList contains [10, 30, 50, 70], yourList will also contain [10, 30, 50, 70]. . Question #33: I thought that 1, 3 and 5 would be displayed. It would actually be 100 300 500. This is because the code segment traverses the list from left to right and displays each value that is greater than or equal to 90. . Question #35: I confused this one a bit. The last line in this code segment would be set maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. . Question #48: I thought that all x, y and z will be displayed but the correct answer is just x and z. This is because the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data trannsmissions and algorithms. .",

Make each letter tangible/clickable. | Create a space where the length unknown word would be shown | Create a space where incorrect guesses, which are not included in the word, are placed | Make the program look more presentable for the user and take into consideration users with disabilities | Keep on updating the word list for our API | Make it so the hangman can “grow” body parts as the user guesses incorrect letters | . Updates/Progress . While we are still working on the frontend aspect of our code, our backend logic is basically fully complete. As our backend developer, I coded the logic for multiple different user input types in python. I created a dictionary which will store various variables such as the randomly generated session ID, the actual word, the defenition, and all of the user’s guesses. This makes it very easy to use if statements and verify if the user’s guess is in the word or not. . Problems we ran into . Merge conflicts - We fixed this by researching on stackoverflow and running the following commands: | . git merge –abort git pull git add file git fetch –all git reset –hard origin/master git merge –continue git reset –hard origin/trunk rm -rf .git/MERGE* git pull origin master git pull origin main git push -f origin comments demo:main git pull -f origin comments demo:main git pull .

            "title": "1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors",
            "content": "Common Errors: . To start, it’s important to note that no one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program; Logic, Syntax, Run-time, and Overflow errors. . Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn’t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as “crashing” and the error is normally referred to as a “bug”. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data. . | Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program’s language, resulting in restrictions. . | . Methods to Correct Errors: . IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn’t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | .",

Hacks . What errors may arise in your project? | . In program development, many small errors occur. These small errors include an incorrect usage of syntax, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so all errors have to be fixed before we push our code. . What are some test cases that can be used? | . Proper inputs for our team&#39;s program would be english words but we would have to test more than just that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them, as we can debug and fgure out how to not let this break the code. .",

Research, Designing, Prototyping, Testing, followed by revisions. Revisions are a key part of this process and will happen several times. This developmental process is iterative and requires refinement and revision based on testing and feedback. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. Investigation is useful in development for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the requirements of the people who will use the program. Investigation can be perfomed by collecting user data, having beta testing, interviews, and direct observations. . How a program is developed . Starts with an idea and initial prototype. Usually developed by teams of people. | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect | Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must determine the requirements and constraints of the program | During investigation, Developers use surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations | Developers create the initial design for the program by brainstorming, storyboarding the program, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules and subdepartments, developing a testing strategy, developers decide on the program requirements that describe how the program should behave. | An incremental process is used so developers can refine small modules of the program | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at both the micro and macro level | Developers use these test results as feedback to further refine and revise the program | .",

Programs are mostly event-driven –&gt; events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program. Input affects output of a program. Outputs can be visual, audio,touch/feel(vibrations), text, etc. A program (aka software) is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment. To describe a code segment, first state what it does, and then include how it does it. . Hacks . My group’s final project idea is to create a hangman version flash cards to help us study with various vocab/questions. The flash cards will be in the format where it asks you a question and you will have a textbox to input your answer. Then it will show you the actual answer of the question and you can compare your questions. This will make studying more fun as it’t flash cards but in a game format. .

            "content": "Aniket Chakradeo . AP CSP . Period 2 . 08/29/22 . August Extra Credit Panel Takeaways . Today’s session was a very insightful and beneficial discussion. The panelists all had different majors and started off by saying how APCSP leads to a vast variety of majors. Essentially, the skills that we are currently learning will help make our future classes easier. After this class, AP CSA is also a good class to take and teaches us more advanced coding techniques. We can use the coding that we learn in a variety of majors. One of the alumni spoke about how he’s currently studying mechanical engineering, and how the skills he learned in this class helped streamline some of the projects he had in college. The panelists really emphasized how despite the class seeming difficult at the start, it’s only going to get easier from here. Several of the speakers really emphasized how in any coding project, having the motivation to start is always one of the hardest parts. But after that, you just have to make a plan for yourself and keep pushing yourself to maintain your plan. Having a plan really helps when doing a large-scale project, as it helps to keep everything organized, so you don’t dive in without figuring out a proper approach. At times, coding is going to be hard. That’s just how it is. But with sheer determination, you can make it through. You have to be willing to spend time and effort on your task at hand, and only then will the results come. One of the panelists mentioned how you shouldn’t cut corners while coding. You need to properly understand the code that you are working with, and try to expand more off of that. It’s also important to note that when you get stuck during coding, you should never be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources around you. If the people around you can’t figure it out, then you can always count on google. As we progress through this year, my understanding of coding will increase massively, and that’s when I should start making my own personal projects. These projects are a good way to build a solid portfolio, and come in handy when you are looking for an internship. Internships are really important, as they help you develop your coding skills more, and teach you effective strategies for how to approach certain projects/scenarios. However during your coding endeavors, one of the biggest things that you need to remember is to only focus on your journey. A lot of the panelists all agreed that there is always going to be someone way better than you at coding. But you shouldn’t let this affect you. As one of the panelists said, just focus on yourself and don’t get worried about how the ‘Steve Jobs’ of the world are doing. In short, this CS journey isn’t a short one and definitely isn’t an easy one. But if you have the motivation, and willingness to keep pushing, then you can do it. .",

            "content": "Claim . Topic and concluding sentences . Lead ins . Evidence . Commentary/analysis . Aniket Chakradeo . Mrs. James . HSE3: Period 4 . 26 August 2024 . Truly Happy . CLAIM: The two most important contributing factors to happiness are doing what you love and being with people that you love. . Doing what you love is one of the most influential factors in determining one’s personal happiness. In the Happy documentary by Roko Belic, we learn about an old Brazilian surfer named Ronaldo Fadul. He doesn’t have much money and is quite aged, but he doesn’t let that affect him. He sees surfing as a religion that he will follow his whole life.(Belic) This story depicts how he is still happy in life despite living a simple life. Surfing keeps him happy and healthy in life. He chose to pursue his passion rather than a typical 9-5 job, and this is why he doesn’t throw a fuss about his living situation. To contrast, we are shown the opposite side of this. Roko Belic’s documentary also shows us the life of Hiroko Uchino in Japan. In Japan, people work simply for the sake of working. They don’t actually love what they are doing, but they just keep working until they die. This phenomenon is known as ‘Karoshi’ (Belic). This example paints a depressing picture of how people in Japan work too much in order to provide for themselves and their families. They work way too much and don’t get much time to spend with their loved ones. This vicious cycle leads to their inevitable death or Karoshi. Essentially, these two examples show us how we should work a job that we truly enjoy doing. We should always do what makes us happy, like the surfer Ronaldo, so that we can live a content life and don’t die miserably like Hiroko Uchino. . The other major contributing factor to happiness we saw in the documentary was being around people that you love. The Happy Documentary by Roko Belic also discusses how people live in Denmark. Denmark is known for having free health care and exceptional co-housing facilities. These co-housing communities have about 15 families living and having fun there. These families work together to cook meals for each other and have a common area where the kids can play together and the adults can sit together and talk (Belic). This shows us that being surrounded by loved ones creates a positive atmosphere. These people don’t have luxurious houses like ours, but they are content with them as they get to spend time together and don’t have to cook every day. They take turns so everyone only has to pitch in once or twice a month. I’ve also really connected with this attribute in the last few years. In March of 2020, the covid-19 pandemic was spreading all around the world and we were sent into lockdown. What started as a 2-week break, quickly became a 2-year quarantine period. During these 2 years, our family barely left the house. That meant that the only people we were seeing and interacting with were us four. For most families, those 2 years were terrible. However, I would say that those were some of the best years of my life. During those 2 years, despite not being able to go outside, or hang out with my friends, I still enjoyed that period as I spent quality time with my family and had a chance to bond with my sister before she goes off to college. All in all, we don’t need fancy things to be happy in life. As long as we are with our loved ones, will we be truly happy. .",

Challenges I faced . I have experience doing block coding, using websites such as scratch or code.org, so I didn&#39;t run into many challenges while developing this quiz. With that being said, I did have problems while using an if/else block. My original plan was to make an if else loop for each question. So if the correct answer was chosen, it would move you to the next question. Else, it would take you to the incorrect answer screen. However, using the if blocks was quite difficult and it didn&#39;t let me customize the if statement as much as I wanted. So I was forced to use on-event blocks for each and every answer option. This made it harder to code my quiz, and due to this my code is much less efficient. . Ways I could further improve my quiz . The first thing I would do is add some more questions. Next I would randomize the order of the questions to make the quiz harder. I also plan to add more gifs and sound effects for every correct answer. Another big thing that I wanted to change was that On the final screen, I wanted to change the &quot;Epic victory royale&quot; title based on the score, because right now, even if you get 0 answers correct, it still says &quot;Epic victory royale&quot;. And lastly, I was also thinking of storing everyones name and score in a dictionary, so I could display a leaderboard for who has the most correct answers. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

Over the years I became quite good at using these websites. At around 11 years old I attended a workshop where I learned how to use MIT App Inventor. Using this I created numerous apps, such as music apps, useful tools, games etc. I also took a coding class in 6th grade where I went more in depth about scratch and created more scratch projects and games. Over quarantine I started working more with python and learned some basics. I also taught some family friends how to block code, which helped me refine my skills as well. Then as freshman year began, I joined the Robotics team (Team Optix 3749), where I learned Java basics and syntax. Coding has been one of my biggest hobbies over the last few years, which is why I decided to take this class. In this class, I’ve learned lots of new things, including how to set up my own personal blog. .",

I also learned how to link jupyter notebooks to my blog. . Week 1 - This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash. . Week 2 - We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far. . Week 3 - This week was a shorter week, and so we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org based on fortnite, and also learned some basic javascript syntax. . Week 4 - This week I learned how to run 2 different types of local servers. One was a flask server and the other one was a docker server. I didn’t have any problems with the flask server, however I ran into some problems involving my M1 Macbook during the docker server. Because of this I had to run my servers on my dad’s computer and learned more about why the servers don’t work on computers with M1 chips. . Week 5 - This week I really customized both my group flask server, and my personal one. I also learned how to create a submenu with links for posts and notebook files. We decided scrum team roles and made a scrum process. Lastly, we also worked more towards planning our final project. . Week 6 - This week, we learned how to use AWS in order to host our flask servers. I bought the domain lyntax.ml and set it so that when I’m running the server, lyntax.ml will open our group flask server, and aniket.lyntax.ml will open up my person flask server. . Week 7 - In this week, we learned the usage of APIs, and how we can use their data stored in our final project. I used an API from RapidAPI, a website filled with APIs that can be used. We also learned methods of how to correct errors in our code, and gave it a shot by trying to correct some python functions of our own. .",
