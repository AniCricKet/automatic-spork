            "content": "Lesson Overview: 3.5 - Boolean Expressions . Here we will focus on: basics of Booleans | its relationship with binary | relational operators | Logical Operators | . | . What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 grades = [90, 65, 60, 75, 95] average = (sum(grades)/(len(grades))) print(&quot;The average is &quot; + str(average)) if average &gt; 80: print(True) else: print(False) . The average is 77.0 False . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;,1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and 12 &gt; 77) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: False 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 88 num2 = 45 sum = (num1 + num2) if sum == 200: print(200) else: print(sum) . 133 . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Psuedocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time Decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are true to execute | . | . score = 82 if (score &gt;= 90): print(&quot;You got an A, congrats!&quot;) else: if (score &gt;= 75): print(&quot;Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial!&quot;) else: print(&quot;You have detention!&quot;) . Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial! . protein = 25 carbs = 36 sugar = 11 if (carbs &gt;= 55 || protein &lt;= 20 || sugar &gt;= 15) { console.log(&quot;Your lunch is too unhealthy, please pick a new one&quot;) } else { if (carbs &lt; 35 || protein &lt; 25) { console.log (&quot;This lunch is alright but try to add some more carbs or protein&quot;) } else { if (sugar &gt;= 11) { console.log (&quot;Looks great but lets see if we can cut down on sugar, we don&#39;t want diabetes!&quot;) } else { console.log (&quot;Amazing, you created a healthy lunch!!!&quot;) } } } . Looks great but lets see if we can cut down on sugar, we don&#39;t want diabetes! . Writing Nested Code Activity . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If a person has at least 8 hours, they are experienced | If a person is experienced their salary is 90k, if they have ten hours or above their salary 150k | If a person is inexperienced their salary is always 50k | print the salary of the person at the end and whether they are experienced or not | . | person = &quot;John&quot; hours = 11 salary = 110000 console.log(person + &quot;&#39;s salary is $&quot; + salary) if (hours &gt;= 8) { console.log(person,&quot;is experienced&quot;) } else { console.log(&quot;Sadly you aren&#39;t experienced enough&quot;) } . John&#39;s salary is $110000 John is experienced . Hacks Assignments: . Conditionals: . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If the product is expired, print &quot;this product is no good&quot; | If the cost is above 50 dollars, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this product is too expensive&quot; | If the cost is 25 dollars but under 50, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this is a regular product&quot; | If the cost is under 25 dollars, print &quot;this is a cheap product&quot; | . | . cost = 51; expired = False if (expired == True): print(&quot;This product is no good&quot;) else: if (cost &gt; 50): print(&quot;This product is too expensive&quot;) elif (cost &lt; 25): print(&quot;This is a cheap product&quot;) else: print(&quot;This is a regular product&quot;) . This product is no good . Boolean/Conditionals: . Create a multiple choice quiz that ... uses Boolean expressions | uses Logical operators | uses Conditional statements | prompts quiz-taker with multiple options (only one can be right) | has at least 3 questions | . | Points will be awarded for creativity, intricacy, and how well Boolean/Binary concepts have been intertwined | . quiz = { &quot;q&quot; : [&quot;Who won the last edition of the Fifa World Cup?&quot;, &quot;How many world cup goals does Messi have in his career so far?&quot;, &quot;Which team has won the most amount of World Cup trophies in the history of the competition?&quot;], &quot;a&quot; : [[&quot;Germany&quot;,&quot;France&quot;,&quot;India&quot;,&quot;Brazil&quot;], [&quot;7&quot;,&quot;16&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;9&quot;], [&quot;Argentina&quot;,&quot;Spain&quot;,&quot;England&quot;,&quot;Brazil&quot;]], &quot;answerkey&quot; : [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;d&quot;], &quot;options&quot; : [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] } print(&quot;Welcome to my World Cup Quiz!&quot;) totalQs = 3 i = 0 score = 0 while i != totalQs: status = False currentquestion = quiz[&quot;q&quot;][i] print(currentquestion + &quot; n&quot;) n = 0 while n &lt; 4: print(str(quiz[&quot;options&quot;][n]) + &quot;: &quot; + str(quiz[&quot;a&quot;][i][n])) n += 1 ans = input(currentquestion) ans.lower() print(&quot;&quot;) while status == False: if ans == &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot; or &quot;d&quot;: if ans == quiz[&quot;answerkey&quot;][i]: score += 1 print(&quot;Congratulations&quot;, ans.lower(), &quot;is correct!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Sadly&quot;, ans.lower(), &quot;is incorrect :(&quot;) status = True else: print(&quot;Enter select a valid option&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is: &quot; + str(score) + &quot; points n&quot;) i += 1 .

Open a terminal in vscode, run command: cd _notebooks, type &#39;wget&#39; and paste this link into said terminal and run it . | Take notes wherever you please, but you will be graded on participating . | . So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, sudying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 2.0203050891044216 seconds for an object that weighs 20 pounds to fall 20.0 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . I decided to make a simulation of acceleration on Earth. The initial velocity and position of the object are set to 0, and the time step, or dt, and number of iterations are set to 0.1 and 1000. The acceleration is set to 9.81 m/s^2, and the simulation is performed by updating the position and velocity of the object at each iteration according to the equations of motion that I&#39;ve learned in physics 1 so far. . velocity = 0 position = 0 # Set time step and number of iterations dt = 0.1 n_iterations = 1000 # Set gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 # Perform simulation for i in range(n_iterations): # Calculate new position position += velocity * dt # Calculate new velocity velocity += g * dt print(velocity) print(position) . 980.999999999995 49000.94999999976 . As we spoke in class, an example of a simulation is Blender. I am currently in 3D animation 1 with Mr Askegreen, and over the past few weeks I&#39;ve made this donut. A key thing to notice is how blender is able to simulate how the light bounces off the donut&#39;s icing. .",

One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was ___. | . Slide 2 . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of ___. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and ___ the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a __ or ___, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . True . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 8 . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 1.0 . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(&quot;The current number is:&quot;, str(varx)) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(&quot;The current number is:&quot;, str(varx)) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . choose value for x 7 The current number is: 22 The current number is: 11.0 The current number is: 34.0 The current number is: 17.0 The current number is: 52.0 The current number is: 26.0 The current number is: 13.0 The current number is: 40.0 The current number is: 20.0 The current number is: 10.0 The current number is: 5.0 The current number is: 16.0 The current number is: 8.0 The current number is: 4.0 The current number is: 2.0 The current number is: 1.0 1.0 . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | .

Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 8 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 5 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): print(*matrix[i]) # for row in matrix: # for col in row: # if (col % 3 == 0): # print(col) # print(&quot; &quot;) # else: # print(col) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] print(&quot;My birthday is&quot;, keyboard[2][3] + keyboard[1][2].lower() + keyboard[3][4].lower() + keyboard[1][6].lower() + keyboard[2][0].lower() + keyboard[1][3].lower() + keyboard[1][5].lower() , str(keyboard[0][2]) + str(keyboard[0][10])) . My birthday is Febuary 20 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s .

            "content": ". Questions . A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . What I missed . I missed 7 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only chose 1. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #16: I put that “The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device.” The correct answer was “The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.”. This is because Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly. . Question #17: I put that “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” The correct answer was “Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.” Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . Question #31: I thought that the answer would be f, but it would actually be h. This is because the character “f” is the character at index 3 of the string element at index 2 in wordList. . Question #32: I thought the contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The actual contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70]. This is because The last assignment statement assigns a copy of myList to yourList. Since myList contains [10, 30, 50, 70], yourList will also contain [10, 30, 50, 70]. . Question #33: I thought that 1, 3 and 5 would be displayed. It would actually be 100 300 500. This is because the code segment traverses the list from left to right and displays each value that is greater than or equal to 90. . Question #35: I confused this one a bit. The last line in this code segment would be set maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. . Question #48: I thought that all x, y and z will be displayed but the correct answer is just x and z. This is because the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data trannsmissions and algorithms. .",

Along with this, framework for the letters and the hangman were created. This week, some of our goals were to… . Make each letter tangible/clickable. | Create a space where the length unknown word would be shown | Create a space where incorrect guesses, which are not included in the word, are placed | Make the program look more presentable for the user and take into consideration users with disabilities | Keep on updating the word list for our API | Make it so the hangman can “grow” body parts as the user guesses incorrect letters | . Updates/Progress . While we are still working on the frontend aspect of our code, our backend logic is basically fully complete. As our backend developer, I coded the logic for multiple different user input types in python. I created a dictionary which will store various variables such as the randomly generated session ID, the actual word, the defenition, and all of the user’s guesses. This makes it very easy to use if statements and verify if the user’s guess is in the word or not. . Problems we ran into . Merge conflicts - We fixed this by researching on stackoverflow and running the following commands: | . git merge –abort git pull git add file git fetch –all git reset –hard origin/master git merge –continue git reset –hard origin/trunk rm -rf .git/MERGE* git pull origin master git pull origin main git push -f origin comments demo:main git pull -f origin comments demo:main git pull . How to code the backend logic in python and link it to the HTML frontend file - We resolved this issue by coding it in a python file, and then using the framework ‘Vue’ to connect both the frontend and the backend. | .

            "title": "1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors",
            "content": "Common Errors: . To start, it’s important to note that no one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program; Logic, Syntax, Run-time, and Overflow errors. . Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn’t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as “crashing” and the error is normally referred to as a “bug”. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data. . | Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program’s language, resulting in restrictions. . | . Methods to Correct Errors: . IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn’t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | .",

Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team.

            "content": "Aniket Chakradeo . AP CSP . Period 2 . 08/29/22 . August Extra Credit Panel Takeaways . Today’s session was a very insightful and beneficial discussion. The panelists all had different majors and started off by saying how APCSP leads to a vast variety of majors. Essentially, the skills that we are currently learning will help make our future classes easier. After this class, AP CSA is also a good class to take and teaches us more advanced coding techniques. We can use the coding that we learn in a variety of majors. One of the alumni spoke about how he’s currently studying mechanical engineering, and how the skills he learned in this class helped streamline some of the projects he had in college. The panelists really emphasized how despite the class seeming difficult at the start, it’s only going to get easier from here. Several of the speakers really emphasized how in any coding project, having the motivation to start is always one of the hardest parts. But after that, you just have to make a plan for yourself and keep pushing yourself to maintain your plan. Having a plan really helps when doing a large-scale project, as it helps to keep everything organized, so you don’t dive in without figuring out a proper approach. At times, coding is going to be hard. That’s just how it is. But with sheer determination, you can make it through. You have to be willing to spend time and effort on your task at hand, and only then will the results come. One of the panelists mentioned how you shouldn’t cut corners while coding. You need to properly understand the code that you are working with, and try to expand more off of that. It’s also important to note that when you get stuck during coding, you should never be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources around you. If the people around you can’t figure it out, then you can always count on google. As we progress through this year, my understanding of coding will increase massively, and that’s when I should start making my own personal projects. These projects are a good way to build a solid portfolio, and come in handy when you are looking for an internship. Internships are really important, as they help you develop your coding skills more, and teach you effective strategies for how to approach certain projects/scenarios. However during your coding endeavors, one of the biggest things that you need to remember is to only focus on your journey. A lot of the panelists all agreed that there is always going to be someone way better than you at coding. But you shouldn’t let this affect you. As one of the panelists said, just focus on yourself and don’t get worried about how the ‘Steve Jobs’ of the world are doing. In short, this CS journey isn’t a short one and definitely isn’t an easy one. But if you have the motivation, and willingness to keep pushing, then you can do it. .",

            "content": "Claim . Topic and concluding sentences . Lead ins . Evidence . Commentary/analysis . Aniket Chakradeo . Mrs. James . HSE3: Period 4 . 26 August 2024 . Truly Happy . CLAIM: The two most important contributing factors to happiness are doing what you love and being with people that you love. . Doing what you love is one of the most influential factors in determining one’s personal happiness. In the Happy documentary by Roko Belic, we learn about an old Brazilian surfer named Ronaldo Fadul. He doesn’t have much money and is quite aged, but he doesn’t let that affect him. He sees surfing as a religion that he will follow his whole life.(Belic) This story depicts how he is still happy in life despite living a simple life. Surfing keeps him happy and healthy in life. He chose to pursue his passion rather than a typical 9-5 job, and this is why he doesn’t throw a fuss about his living situation. To contrast, we are shown the opposite side of this. Roko Belic’s documentary also shows us the life of Hiroko Uchino in Japan. In Japan, people work simply for the sake of working. They don’t actually love what they are doing, but they just keep working until they die. This phenomenon is known as ‘Karoshi’ (Belic). This example paints a depressing picture of how people in Japan work too much in order to provide for themselves and their families. They work way too much and don’t get much time to spend with their loved ones. This vicious cycle leads to their inevitable death or Karoshi. Essentially, these two examples show us how we should work a job that we truly enjoy doing. We should always do what makes us happy, like the surfer Ronaldo, so that we can live a content life and don’t die miserably like Hiroko Uchino. . The other major contributing factor to happiness we saw in the documentary was being around people that you love. The Happy Documentary by Roko Belic also discusses how people live in Denmark. Denmark is known for having free health care and exceptional co-housing facilities. These co-housing communities have about 15 families living and having fun there. These families work together to cook meals for each other and have a common area where the kids can play together and the adults can sit together and talk (Belic). This shows us that being surrounded by loved ones creates a positive atmosphere. These people don’t have luxurious houses like ours, but they are content with them as they get to spend time together and don’t have to cook every day. They take turns so everyone only has to pitch in once or twice a month. I’ve also really connected with this attribute in the last few years. In March of 2020, the covid-19 pandemic was spreading all around the world and we were sent into lockdown. What started as a 2-week break, quickly became a 2-year quarantine period. During these 2 years, our family barely left the house. That meant that the only people we were seeing and interacting with were us four. For most families, those 2 years were terrible. However, I would say that those were some of the best years of my life. During those 2 years, despite not being able to go outside, or hang out with my friends, I still enjoyed that period as I spent quality time with my family and had a chance to bond with my sister before she goes off to college. All in all, we don’t need fancy things to be happy in life. As long as we are with our loved ones, will we be truly happy. .",

Challenges I faced . I have experience doing block coding, using websites such as scratch or code.org, so I didn&#39;t run into many challenges while developing this quiz. With that being said, I did have problems while using an if/else block. My original plan was to make an if else loop for each question. So if the correct answer was chosen, it would move you to the next question. Else, it would take you to the incorrect answer screen. However, using the if blocks was quite difficult and it didn&#39;t let me customize the if statement as much as I wanted. So I was forced to use on-event blocks for each and every answer option. This made it harder to code my quiz, and due to this my code is much less efficient. . Ways I could further improve my quiz . The first thing I would do is add some more questions. Next I would randomize the order of the questions to make the quiz harder. I also plan to add more gifs and sound effects for every correct answer. Another big thing that I wanted to change was that On the final screen, I wanted to change the &quot;Epic victory royale&quot; title based on the score, because right now, even if you get 0 answers correct, it still says &quot;Epic victory royale&quot;. And lastly, I was also thinking of storing everyones name and score in a dictionary, so I could display a leaderboard for who has the most correct answers. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Over the years I became quite good at using these websites. At around 11 years old I attended a workshop where I learned how to use MIT App Inventor. Using this I created numerous apps, such as music apps, useful tools, games etc. I also took a coding class in 6th grade where I went more in depth about scratch and created more scratch projects and games. Over quarantine I started working more with python and learned some basics. I also taught some family friends how to block code, which helped me refine my skills as well. Then as freshman year began, I joined the Robotics team (Team Optix 3749), where I learned Java basics and syntax. Coding has been one of my biggest hobbies over the last few years, which is why I decided to take this class. In this class, I’ve learned lots of new things, including how to set up my own personal blog. .",

I also learned how to link jupyter notebooks to my blog. . Week 1 - This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash. . Week 2 - We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far. . Week 3 - This week was a shorter week, and so we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org based on fortnite, and also learned some basic javascript syntax. . Week 4 - This week I learned how to run 2 different types of local servers. One was a flask server and the other one was a docker server. I didn’t have any problems with the flask server, however I ran into some problems involving my M1 Macbook during the docker server. Because of this I had to run my servers on my dad’s computer and learned more about why the servers don’t work on computers with M1 chips. . Week 5 - This week I really customized both my group flask server, and my personal one. I also learned how to create a submenu with links for posts and notebook files. We decided scrum team roles and made a scrum process. Lastly, we also worked more towards planning our final project. . Week 6 - This week, we learned how to use AWS in order to host our flask servers. I bought the domain lyntax.ml and set it so that when I’m running the server, lyntax.ml will open our group flask server, and aniket.lyntax.ml will open up my person flask server. . Week 7 - In this week, we learned the usage of APIs, and how we can use their data stored in our final project. I used an API from RapidAPI, a website filled with APIs that can be used. We also learned methods of how to correct errors in our code, and gave it a shot by trying to correct some python functions of our own. .",
