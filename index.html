Unit 1 Table - Intro to Tools and Resources

| Week | Topics | Review Ticket | Summary |
|-|-|
| 0 | [Tool Setup](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/0) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/2) | I learned how to install all the software required for coding, and basics of VSCode and Github. I also learned how to link Jupyter Notebooks to my blog. |
| 1 | [Intro to Python](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/1) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/3) | This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash while creating a bash script in Jupyter Notebooks. |
| 2 | [Data Abstraction](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/2) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/4) | We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far.  |
| 3 | [Creative Development](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/3) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/5) | This week was a shorter week, and we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org and also learned some basic javascript syntax. I also began the creative development project outline with my partner. |
