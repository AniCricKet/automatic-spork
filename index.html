Unit 1 Table - Intro to Tools and Resources

| Week | Topics | Review Ticket | Summary |
|-|-|
| 0 | [Tool Setup](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/0) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/2) | I learned how to install all the software required for coding, and basics of VSCode and Github. I also learned how to link Jupyter Notebooks to my blog. |
| 1 | [Intro to Python](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/1) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/3) | This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash while creating a bash script in Jupyter Notebooks. |
| 2 | [Data Abstraction](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/2) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/4) | We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far.  |
| 3 | [Creative Development](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/3) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/5) | This week was a shorter week, and we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org and also learned some basic javascript syntax. I also began the creative development project outline with my partner. |

Unit 2 Table - Intro to WebDev

| Week | Topics | Review Ticket | Summary |
|-|-|
| 4 | [Web Server](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//points/4) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/6) | This week I learned how to run 2 different types of local servers. One was a flask server and the other one was a docker server. I didn't have any problems with the flask server, however I ran into some problems involving my M1 Macbook during the docker server. Because of this I had to run my servers on my dad's computer and learned more about why the servers don't work on computers with M1 chips. |
| 5 | [User Interface Starters](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//points/5) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/7) | This week I really customized both my group flask server, and my personal one. I also learned how to create a submenu with links for posts and notebook files. We decided scrum team roles and made a scrum process. Lastly, we also worked more towards planning our final project. |
| 6 | [Deployment](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//points/6) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/8) | This week, we learned how to use AWS in order to host our flask servers. I bought the domain lyntax.ml and set it so that when I'm running the server, lyntax.ml will open our group flask server, and aniket.lyntax.ml will open up my person flask server. |
| 7 | [API](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//points/7) | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/automatic-spork/issues/9) | In this week, we learned the usage of APIs, and how we can use their data stored in our final project. I used an API from RapidAPI, a website filled with APIs that can be used. We also learned methods of how to correct errors in our code, and gave it a shot by trying to correct some python functions of our own. |
