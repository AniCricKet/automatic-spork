<p>I haven’t took this coure yet, but I plan to take it in the future so this was a good opportunity to see what some of the students are able to do, and gave me a bit of an incentive to take the course.</p>

<p>I definetly am not the most gifted when it comes to art however I am still a big fan of looking at good art pieces. Hence, I was really impressed by the quality of drawings these kids had made. Some of them looked so realistic it just blew my mind.</p>

<p>I’m not very familiar with how ceramics works, so it was really cool to see how students were able to create such unique shapes and also make them shiny.</p>
