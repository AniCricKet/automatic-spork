# [Our Final Project](lyntax.ml)

## Week 2 Progress

### Our goals for the start of the week

In Week 1, we managed to create an api that would be able to display the defination of a word unknown to the user. Along with this, framework for the letters and the hangman were created.

This week, the plan is to . . .

Make each letter tangible.
Create a space where the unknown word would be shown
Create a space where letters not included in the word and guesses by the user are placed.
Make the program look presentable for the user.
Keep on updating the word api.(Best to start work in google drive and then move to VS code)
If we have time . . .

Make it so the hangman can "grow" body parts.
