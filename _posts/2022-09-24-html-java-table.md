# Here is a demonstration of using HTML fragments and Java to make a table
I'm making a table of the top 5 run scorers in cricket

| Number | Player | Innings | Runs | Average |
|-|-|
| 1 | Sachin Tendulkar |  |  |  |
| 2 | Kumar Sangakkara |  |  |  |
| 3 | Ricky Ponting |  |  |  |
| 4 | Sanath Jayasuriya |  |  |  |
| 5 | Virat Kohli |  |  |  |


Here's pictures of the bats that they used, kept in a museum that I visited over the summer:
