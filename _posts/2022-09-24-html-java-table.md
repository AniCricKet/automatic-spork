# Here is a demonstration of using HTML fragments and Java to make a table
I'm making a table of the top 5 run scorers in cricket

| Number | Player | Innings | Runs | Average |
|-|-|
| 1 | Sachin Tendulkar | 452 | 18426 | 44.83 |
| 2 | Kumar Sangakkara | 380 | 14234 | 42.00 |
| 3 | Ricky Ponting | 365 | 13704 | 42.00 |
| 4 | Sanath Jayasuriya | 433 | 13430 | 32.40 |
| 5 | Virat Kohli | 252* | 12344 | 57.70 |


Here's pictures of the bats that they used, kept in a museum that I visited over the summer:
