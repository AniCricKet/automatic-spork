This is the beginning of planning for the Create Performance Task assignment. More will be added to this post as weeks go by until it is time to code.

What I know that could help with the project:

- How to make a quiz
- How to create list
- How to use dictionaries
- How to explain the code I have made


What I need for the project:

- Learn how to use different functions
- Learn how to display variables correctly
- Look at examples of bad, good, and great Performance Task Projects
- Look over the college board requirements



# Week 3-Brainstorming

Purposes of the project:

- test the user's senses
- test the user's knowlegde of a given topic

Sample ideas for the project:

- A game that involves the user to use one of their 5 senses to complete a simple task quickly.
- A quiz in a unique style; Jeopardy, Head to Head, or 5 seconds.
