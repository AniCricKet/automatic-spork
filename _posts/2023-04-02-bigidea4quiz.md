Q3: In this question, there was a diagram and we had to say what the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed in the network before computer E can no longer communicate with computer F? However I misunderstood this question. The question is asking how many links before the computer can't communicate with the other computer at all, but I thought it was just stopping 1 path.

Q6: This question was about the contents of an Internet packet. The question asked to describe how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet? I thought that the answer was that each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data. But the correct answer was that each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.

Q43: This question was asking which of the options was not an example of procedural abstraction. I put that providing more opportunities for code reuse, but this is wrong because the use of procedures provides opportunities for code reuse. The correct answer is making the code run faster

Q47: This question was about binary search on list of time stamps. The question asked about a time stamp which indicates the date and time that a measurement was taken. A data scientist has a list containing 10,000 time stamps, sorted in chronological order. Which of the following is closest to the maximum number of values that will need to be examined when performing a binary search for a value in the list? I thought the answer was 5,000 but this is wrong because a binary search on a list of length 10,000 will eliminate 5,000 elements on the first iteration, fewer than 5,000 iterations are needed to find the target value or to determine that it is not in the list.


# Summary:

Even though I made a few errors on the multiple-choice questions, the majority were simply careless mistakes. To avoid this during the AP test, it is important to take extra care while reading both the questions and all of the answer choices.
