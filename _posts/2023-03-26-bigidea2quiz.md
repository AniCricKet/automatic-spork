Reflection:

I don't have any corrections because I got a 100%. I thought this quiz was fairly easy as a lot of the questions had been asked on previous quizzes throughout Big Idea 2. I feel like I have grasped all the topics of Big Idea 2 pretty well. In this Big Idea, we've learned about binary numbers, lossy and lossless data compression, extracting information, and using programs with data. I feel like these topics are pretty straight forward and I have a pretty clear understanding of everything.
