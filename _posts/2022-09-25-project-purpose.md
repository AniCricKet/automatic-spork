# Video Notes

Computer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text). Programs are mostly event-driven –> events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program. Input affects output of a program. Outputs can be visual, audio,touch/feel(vibrations), text, etc. A program (aka software) is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment. To describe a code segment, first state what it does, and then include how it does it.

# Hacks

My group’s final project idea is to create a hangman version flash cards to help us study with various vocab/questions. The flash cards will be in the format where it asks you a question and you will have a textbox to input your answer. Then it will show you the actual answer of the question and you can compare your questions. This will make studying more fun as it't flash cards but in a game format.

* It is for an educational purpose because it’ll help us develop our coding vocabulary. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as ways to test your knowledge.

* This project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because it helps with studying which is very important to people’s lives.

* This project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission:

* The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can study for a subject.

* Information such as the questions and answers will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.

* The list will have to contain the items to display.

* The procedures will involve creating questions and answers for those questions.

* Randomizing questions will require an algorithmn.

* There can be functions such as “quizes” that need to call different values from different places.
