## Questions I missed:

Q22 - Two Robots in seperate grids try to reach the goal. The option I chose was incorrect because although the program will not move the robot to the gray square in Grid II, it will correctly move the robot to the gray square in Grid I.

Q34 - Move Robot to gray square. The answer I chose was incorrect. The robot needs to rotate right instead of left after the block of 2 moves forward.

Q49 - Crowd flow simulation. The answer I chose was incorrect. The model used by a simulation can be modified, both before and after running the simulation. In fact, one of the benefits of using a simulation is the ease of modification.

Q50 - Which algorithms run in reasonable time. The answer I chose was incorrect. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2^n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time.

## Summary:

Looking back I notice that the problems I messed up with all had something in common. The first 2 of them involve robots moving to certain squares. The next one was just a lapse in concentration and the last one was kind of hard to visualize originally but it makes more sense now. I think in the future to improve I would carefully read and analyze the problem, review all the answer choices, and to double-check my work.
