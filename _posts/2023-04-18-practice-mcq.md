Summary:

Although I had almost forgotten and knew little about many of the topics on the practice test, I was able to successfully answer the questions by comparing the information to what I already knew about computer needs and possible options. However, I recognize that I need to study more in the areas where I required extra help, such as metadata, lossy vs lossless compression, and encryption processes. Additionally, I struggled with time management during the test, but I plan to employ strategies to complete the test more quickly. For instance, when facing a problem with a complex setup, I will read the question first and analyze the answer choices to identify areas that are not possible. Then, I will read the rest of the problem to determine the correct answer and confirm that the other options are not feasible.
