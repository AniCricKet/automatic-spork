Summary:

Overall I thought I understood the topics on the mcq test pretty well. There were 2 questions that I missed, and one of them was because of a lapse in concentration. The other one was about an overflow error, with the question being, "In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?" I thought the answer was "The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.", but that is wrong because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. I think I am doing pretty well leading up to the AP Exam, and for the final MCQ test, I plan on timing myself to make sure I am doing well on that aspect as well.
