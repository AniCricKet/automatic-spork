I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far.</td>

I didn’t have any problems with the flask server, however I ran into some problems involving my M1 Macbook during the docker server. Because of this I had to run my servers on my dad’s computer and learned more about why the servers don’t work on computers with M1 chips.</td>

We also learned methods of how to correct errors in our code, and gave it a shot by trying to correct some python functions of our own.</td>

One thing we could improve upon would be to give the students more time when we assign them an excercise. Overall it was a good learning experience and I took a lot from it. I also began organizing my vocab page</td>
