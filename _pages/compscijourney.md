# My Computer Science Journey


I began my coding journey at around 9 years old. I began by doing block coding on scratch or code.org. Over the years I became quite good at using these websites. At around 11 years old I attended a workshop where I learned how to use MIT App Inventor. Using this I created numerous apps, such as music apps, useful tools, games etc. I also took a coding class in 6th grade where I went more in depth about scratch and created more scratch projects and games. Over quarantine I started working more with python and learned some basics. I also taught some family friends how to block code, which helped me refine my skills as well. Then as freshman year began, I joined the Robotics team (Team Optix 3749), where I learned Java basics and syntax. Coding has been one of my biggest hobbies over the last few years, which is why I decided to take this class. In this class, I've learned lots of new things, including how to set up my own personal blog.
