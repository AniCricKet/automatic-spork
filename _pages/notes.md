# Notes/Important takeaways

Week 0 - I learned how to install all the software required for coding, and basics of VSCode and Github. I also learned how to link jupyter notebooks to my blog.

Week 1 - This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash.

Week 2 - We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far. 

Week 3 - This week was a shorter week, and so we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org based on fortnite, and also learned some basic javascript syntax.

Week 4 - This week I learned how to run 2 different types of local servers. One was a flask server and the other one was a docker server. I didn't have any problems with the flask server, however I ran into some problems involving my M1 Macbook during the docker server. Because of this I had to run my servers on my dad's computer and learned more about why the servers don't work on computers with M1 chips.

Week 5 - This week I really customized both my group flask server, and my personal one. I also learned how to create a submenu with links for posts and notebook files. We decided scrum team roles and made a scrum process. Lastly, we also worked more towards planning our final project.

Week 6 - This week, we learned how to use AWS in order to host our flask servers. I bought the domain lyntax.ml and set it so that when I'm running the server, lyntax.ml will open our group flask server, and aniket.lyntax.ml will open up my person flask server.

Week 7 - In this week, we learned the usage of APIs, and how we can use their data stored in our final project. I used an API from RapidAPI, a website filled with APIs that can be used. We also learned methods of how to correct errors in our code, and gave it a shot by trying to correct some python functions of our own.
