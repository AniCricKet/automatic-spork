# Notes/Important takeaways

Week 0 - I learned how to install all the software required for coding, and basics of VSCode and Github. I also learned how to link jupyter notebooks to my blog.

Week 1 - This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I decided to make mine soccer themed, and so I applied the lessons of how to insert images. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash.

Week 2 - We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far. 

Week 3 - This week was a shorter week, and so we learned how to use code.org. I created a 3 question mini quiz on code.org based on fortnite, and also learned some basic javascript syntax.
